2. Clone down the repo with `$ git clone git@github.com:username/reponame.git`
3. Delete the `demo/` folder and `screenshot.png` files
4. Install bundler with `$ gem install bundler`
5. Install gems with `$ bundle install`
6. Run Jekyll with `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
7. Begin hacking for your project

(If you are serving your blog at github, make sure to enale the gh-pages at yout repo settings)

### As a Jekyll >= 3.3 theme gem

If you already have a jekyll project, jump to the instructions bellow. Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. Install jekyll and bundler with `$ gem install jekyll bundler`.
2. Create your website `jekyll new my-awesome-blog`.
3. `cd my-awesome-blog`

Inside the project folder, install the theme as follows:

1. Download the starter `/demo` content, [quick download link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/tree/master/demo) and extract the content to the blog folter.
2. Install bundler with `$ gem install bundler`
3. Install gems with `$ bundle install`
4. Run Jekyll with `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
5. Begin hacking for your project


### Boilerplate & Theme differences

The boilerplate kit is better for more drastic hacking and changes, a project that's quite different to any other and needs a lot of custom work done. Additionally you'll only be able to use this method if you want to host it on GitHub Pages, as [themes can't be submitted](https://pages.github.com/themes/)... yet.

Using the theme will allow you to receive updates made and will be more programmatic. To make your own changes you'll need to overwrite the files with your own.

### Disqus Comments

Create a [Disqus](http://disqus.com) account and change `disqus_shortname` in `_config.yml` to the Disqus *shortname* you just setup. By default comments appear on all post and pages if you assigned a shortname. To disable commenting on a post or page, add the following to its YAML Front Matter:

    comments: false

### Social Share Links

To disable Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ share links on a post or page, add the following to its front matter:

    share: false

### Floating Social Share Links

To enable floating share links on the left of the screen, edit it on `_config.yml`:

    float_share: true

### Owner/Author Information

Change your name, and avatar photo (200x200 pixels or larger), email, and social networking URLs. If you want to link to an external image on Gravatar or something similar you'll need to edit the path in `_includes/author.html` since it assumes it is hosted on your site.

### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Your Google Analytics ID goes here along with meta tags for [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownershi) site verification.

### Top Menu - Navigation Links

To add additional links in the menu edit `_config.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like. *External links will open in a new window..* You can create a sub-category using the `submenu` item. Also, you can list your post categories setting the `type: 'categories'`


    menu:
      - title: 'Home'
        url: '/'
      - title: 'Fork'
        url: 'http://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme'
      - title: 'Tags'
        url: '/tags'
      - title: 'Categories'
        url: '/categories'
        type: 'categories'
      - title: 'Favorites'
        url: '#'
        submenu:
          - title: 'highlighter'
            url: '/code-highlighting-post/'
          - title: 'intro'
            url: '/sample-post/'

### Adding New Content with Octopress

While completely optional, I've included Octopress and some starter templates to automate the creation of new posts and pages. To take advantage of it start by installing the [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) gem if it isn't already.

    $ gem install octopress

#### New Post

Default command

    $ octopress new post "Post Title"

Default works great if you want all your posts in one directory, but if you're like me and want to group them into subfolders like `/posts`, `/portfolio`, etc. Then this is the command for you. By specifying the DIR it will create a new post in that folder and populate the `categories:` YAML with the same value.

    $ octopress new post "New Portfolio Post Title" --dir portfolio

#### New Page

To create a new page use the following command.

    $ octopress new page new-page/

### Style Customization

Here you'll find some useful scss variables to help you to customize your Blog interface. All variables can be found at `_sass/_variables.scss`.

#### Top Navbar Size

To change its size, edit the **`$menu-height`** value. It's recommended a value between 50px and 100px. This variable will automatically update the icon and menu size for you.

#### Top Navbar Colors

The navbar uses two colors, the top color and overflow color. The top color represents the navbar color when the window is not scrolled and the overflow color represents the color when we have a sufficient scroll to change its color.

You can change these colors using the **`$menu-top`** and **`$menu-overflow`** variable values.

#### Top Navbar hover color

The color that you see in the item under the mouse can be changed in the **`$header-margin`** variable.

### Further Customization

Jekyll 2.x added support for Sass files making it much easier to modify a theme's fonts and colors. By editing values found in `_sass/variables.scss` you can fine tune the site's colors and typography.

For example if you wanted a red background instead of white you'd change `$bodycolor: #fff;` to `$bodycolor: $cc0033;`.

To modify the site's JavaScript files I setup a Grunt build script to lint/concatenate/minify all scripts into `scripts.min.js`. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), then [install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then finally install the dependencies for the theme contained in `package.json`:

    npm install

From the theme's root, use `grunt` to concatenate JavaScript files and optimize `.jpg`, `.png` and `.svg` files in the `images/` folder.

You can also use `grunt dev` in combination with `bundle exec jekyll serve` to watch for updates in JS files that Grunt will then automatically re-build as you write your code, which will in turn auto-generate your Jekyll site when developing locally.

## Questions?

Having a problem getting something to work or want to know why I setup something in a certain way?  [File a GitHub Issue](http://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/issues/new). And if you make something cool with this theme feel free to let me know.

## Contributing


Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.
