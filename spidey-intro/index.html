<h2>The start</h2>
<p>During this series I'll be sharing my experience about reversing the game Spiderman 2000, as well how I was able to overcome some of the problems and riddles the game presented to me. Everything you'll see here is related to my <a href="http://www.github.com/krystalgamer/spidey-tools">spidey-tools</a> repository that contains all the tools that I've developed to mod the game.</p>
<h2>Mix of <em>dumb-luck</em> and knowledge</h2>
<p>This is not the first game I've reversed but this is the <strong>FIRST</strong> PC Port that I've reversed and let me tell you it's a really bad port. Spiderman PC games have a bad reputation due to being lazy ports(such as this one) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOU6HVSL6a8">total garbage</a> because Activision neglected the PC market. Luckily they left a bunch of debug messages in the code but <strong>disabled the debug print</strong> for whatever reason.
This helped me a lot during my initial first-steps with the game because I could easily have a general idea of what I was supposedly looking at.</p>
<h2>Will you cover every tool you've posted on your repository?</h2>
<p>YES! I have so much to say about each one(except texture-repacker, by far the most boring and useless tool I've written), that's why I decided to write this.</p>
<p><em>Well... That's all folks stay tuned for future posts ;)</em></p>
