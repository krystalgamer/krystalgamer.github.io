# What is it?
{: .center}

It's a container format used to store all the game's files. It was developed by Neversoft and is most known for its use on "Tony Hawk Pro Skater" game series.
Since it contains all game files in order to modify anything we need to know what is going on.

# Structure
{: .center}

```c
typedef struct{
	uint32_t magic;
	uint32_t dirOffset;
}PKR3File;
```

The files start with a magic number `PKR3` followed by an offset to the directory tree header.

{: .center}

As you can see after the offset there are the words `RIFF` and `WAVE` which are also magic numbers of [WAV files](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/). Due to the fact that `spidey.exe` contains a lot of file names this mislead me. Initally I thought this files had no structure and were just a bunch of files merged together. Thankfully there are a lot of references in the code to the functions responsible to handle PKR files.

## Dir structure
{: .center}

## The header

```c
typedef struct{
	uint32_t unk;
	uint32_t numDirs;
	uint32_t numFiles;
}PKRDirHeader;
```

*Quick note: You'll see a lot of variables/members called `unk` due to the fact that I have no ideia of what they do and their modification not having any sign of impact on the file interpretation and not existing any references to it in the cose.*

It contains the number of directories and the **total** number of files that the PKR holds.

## The body

```c
typedef struct{
	char name[0x20];
	uint32_t unk;
	uint32_t numFiles;
}PKRDir;
```

After the header there's an array of PKRDirs(its lenght is defined by `numDirs`). And right after this there's a PKRFile array with the lenght of the total number of files.

```c
typedef struct{
	union{
		uint8_t total[0x34];
		struct{
			char name[0x20];
			uint32_t crc;
			uint32_t compressed;
			uint32_t fileOffset;
			uint32_t uncompressedSize;
			uint32_t compressedSize;
		};
	};
}PKRFile;
```

As you can see the game files have integrity checks, in this case it's actually [CRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check).

`compressed` can either hold 2(0x00000002) or -2(0xFFFFFFFE) which mean compressed and uncompressed respectively.

`fileOffset` contains the offset to file in the PKR file **counting from the start**.

`compressedSize` holds the size of the compressed files.

`uncompressedSize` holds the size of the uncompressed files **OR** the size of a compressed file when decompressed.



Here's how all these structures look in the file:

## Compression method
{: .center}

The files are compressed using zlib. Finding it was a piece of cake, again there are **a lot** of references in the strings.

Implementing it was the hardest part, during this period I got so many crashes that I decided to simply go with uncompress(). I know it sucks because it wastes a lot of cpu power but hey, it works ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
