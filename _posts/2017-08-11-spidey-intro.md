## The start
{: .center}

During this series i'll be sharing my experience about reversing the game Spiderman 2000, as well how i was able to overcome some of the problems and riddles the game presented to me. Everything you'll see here is related to my [spidey-tools](http://www.github.com/krystalgamer/spidey-tools) repository that contains all the tools that i've developed to mod the game.


## Mix of *dumb-luck* and knowledge

This is not the first game i've reversed but this is the **FIRST** PC Port that I've reversed and let me tell you it's a really bad port. Spiderman PC games have a bad reputation due to being lazy ports(such as this one) and [total garbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOU6HVSL6a8) because Activision neglected the PC market. Luckily they left a bunch of debug messages in the code but **disabled the debug print** for whatever reason.
This helped me a lot during my initial first-steps with the game because I could easily have a general ideia of what I was supposedly looking at.

## Will you cover every tool you've posted on your repository?

YES! I have so much to say about each one(except texture-repacker, by far the most boring and useless tool I've written), that's why I decided to write this.


*Well... That's all folks stay tuned for future posts ;)*
